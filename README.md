# shopping_cart
Shopping cart testing application fulfilling test cases from the requirement specification

## Installation

Install the package through [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). Edit your project's `composer.json` file by adding:

### Laravel 4.2 and below

```php
"require": {
	"laravel/framework": "4.2.*",
	"gloudemans/shoppingcart": "~1.2"
}
```

Next, run the Composer update command from the Terminal:

    composer update

Now all you have to do is point the virtual host to this path `shopping_cart/public`

Now you're ready to use shopping cart application.
